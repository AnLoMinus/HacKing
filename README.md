## Who is a hacker? :man_technologist:
<p>A Hacker is a person who finds and exploits the weakness in computer systems and/or networks to gain access. Hackers are usually skilled computer programmers with knowledge of computer security.
Hackers are classified according to the intent of their actions. The following list classifies hackers according to their intent.</p>

* [White hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) &nbsp; A hacker who gains access to systems with a view to fix the identified weaknesses. They may also perform penetration Testing and vulnerability assessments
* [Black hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)) &nbsp; A hacker who gains unauthorized access to computer systems for personal gain. The intent is usually to steal corporate data, violate privacy rights, transfer funds from bank accounts etc.
* [Grey hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat) &nbsp; A hacker who is in between ethical and black hat hackers. He/she breaks into computer systems without authority with a view to identify weaknesses and reveal them to the system owner.

## Who Uses Kali Linux?
#### Following are the professionals who utilize Kali Linux to perform various operations and describe the best use of Kali Linux:

[Network Administrators](): Network administrators use Linux to detect and eradicate rogue access points, audit their network, maintain security. And simulate attacks on their network to find potential vulnerabilities.

[Security Administrators](): These professionals are responsible for protecting valuable information and institutional data from unauthorized visitors. A security administrator uses Linux tools for testing the environment and discovers vulnerabilities that might pose a threat to the data in the future.

[Network Architect](): They use Linux to find the hidden flaws in the architecture and design a secure network environment. Also, they use it to test the environment and see if there is any misconfiguration that has been overlooked in the network infrastructure.

[Pen Testers](): Pentesters are the cybersecurity experts whom an organization hires to review their infrastructure and find the vulnerabilities or flaws within the network. A Pentester uses Linux to perform penetration testing, and audit the environment for which he is hired to review.

[Forensic Engineer](): Forensic engineers leverage Linux‚Äôs ‚Äòforensic mode‚Äô to discover the missing data and recover it safely back to the system. They also design data backup strategies for the organization so that the data can be safely recovered in case a cyberattack happens.

[CISO](): The chief information security officers utilize Kali Linux resources to audit the environment both internally and externally to discover rouge configurations and applications that have been released in the system and might compromise it.

[Black Hat Hackers](): These are the bad guys you see in the movies trying to hack into a facility or breaking the government security and control over the infrastructure. They generally use Kali Linux to discover the vulnerabilities and infiltrate them into the system. Linux features various applications for social engineering that can be used to hack an individual or entire organization.

[White Hat Hackers](): Opposite to black hat hackers, these are the good guys using the same tools and expertise to discover any vulnerabilities and prevent or stop the attack in the early stages.

[Computer Enthusiasts](): It‚Äôs a generic term given for the people like you and me, who‚Äôs interested in hacking, penetration testing, and learning new technologies. Computer enthusiasts or hobbyists use Linux to learn more about networking, cybersecurity, vulnerabilities, operating systems, and information security.
