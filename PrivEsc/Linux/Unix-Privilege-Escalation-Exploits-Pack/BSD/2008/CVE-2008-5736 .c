/*
 * FreeBSD <= 6.4-RELEASE Netgraph Exploit
 * by zx2c4
 * 
 * 
 * This is an exploit for CVE-2008-5736, the FreeBSD protosw
 * and loosely based on Don Bailey's 2008 exploit -
 * http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7581/ . The thing with
 * Don's exploit is that it relies on having a known location
 * of allproc, which means having access to the kernel or
 * debugging symbols, either of which might not be available.
 * Initial attempts included a general memory search for some
 * characteristics of allproc, but this was difficult to make
 * reliable. This solution here is a much more standard - get
 * the current thread, change its permissions, and execl to
 * shell. Additionally, it breaks out of chroots and freebsd
 * jails by reparenting to pid 1 and copying its fds.
 *
 * This reliably works on kernels on or below 6.4-RELEASE:
 *
 * $ gcc a.c
 * $ ./a.out
 * ~ FreeBSD <= 6.4-RELEASE Netgraph Exploit ~
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ by zx2c4 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * ~~~~~ greetz to don bailey, edemveiss ~~~~~
 *
 * [+] mmapping null page
 * [+] adding jmp to pwnage in null page
 * [+] opening netgraph socket
 * [+] triggering null dereference
 * [+] elevating permissions
 * [+] got root!
 * #
 *
 * It's an oldie, but simple enough that someone needed
 * to write another PoC exploit at some point.
 *
 * cheers,
 * zx2c4, 27-2-2011
