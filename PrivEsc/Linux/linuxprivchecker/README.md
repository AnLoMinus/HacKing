#                   Linux Privilege Escalation Check Script

## [Details:] 
Originally forked from the linuxprivchecker.py (Mike Czumak), this script
is intended to be executed locally on a Linux box to enumerate basic system 
info and search for common privilege escalation vectors such as word 
writable files, misconfigurations, clear-text password and applicable 
exploits.
