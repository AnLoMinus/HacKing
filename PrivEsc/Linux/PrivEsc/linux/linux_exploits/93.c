/**
 * rp9-priv-esc.c 
 *
 * A local privilege escalation attack against the community supported
 * version of Real.com's Realplayer, version 9.
 *
 * Written by:
 * 	
 * 	Jon Hart warchild spoofed.org
 *
 * By default, configuration files are stored in ~$USER/.realnetworks/, 
 * but all the files in there are group writeable.  So long as ~$USER 
 * has group execution permissions (which is pretty common), a malicious
 * local user can edit the config files of fellow users to do his biddings.  
 *
 * There are a number of ways to attack this, but after some poking it seems
 * that modifying the path to shared libraries and writing my own malicious
 * shared libraries was the easiest.  
 * 
 * (as an aside, just because the shared libraries in the directories contained
 * in ~$USER/.realnetworks/RealShared_0_0/ are stripped doesn't mean we can't get 
 * the symbols back.  objdump quickly can tell us what the names of the 15 
 * functions are, and we can stub out a bogus shared library pretty quickly.)
 *
 * This particular bit of code is meant to replace the shared library 
 * cook.so.6.0, which is contained in the Codecs directory.  To execute this 
 * attack against a fellow local user, first edit their config file 
 * (~victim/.realnetworks/RealShared_0_0) to have the 'dt_codecs' variable
 * point to a directory under your control, like /tmp/Codecs.  Copy all of the 
 * existing files from the previous value of dt_codecs (which is usually something
 * like ~victim/Real/Codecs/) to /tmp/Codecs.  Next, compile the code below as a
 * shared library and copy it to the trojaned directory:
 *
 * 
 * `gcc -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/Codecs/cook.so.6.0 rp9-priv-esc.c`
 *
 *	The next time the victim fires up realplayer 9, a nice little shell 
 * will be listening on port 12345 for you:
 *
 * guest@haiti:/$ id
 * uid=1006(guest) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
 * guest@haiti:/$ nc localhost 12345
 * id
 * uid=1000(warchild) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),40(src),1003(wheel)
 *
 * Of course, you don't have to execute a shell.  Do whatever makes you happy.
 *
 * Fix?  `chmod 700 ~/.realnetworks/*`
