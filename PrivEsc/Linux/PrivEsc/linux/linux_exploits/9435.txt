/* dedicated to my best friend in the whole world, Robin Price
   the joke is in your hands

   just too easy -- some nice library functions for reuse here though

   credits to julien tinnes/tavis ormandy for the bug

   may want to remove the __attribute__((regparm(3))) for 2.4 kernels,
   I have no time to test

spender@www:~$ cat redhat_hehe
I bet Red Hat will wish they closed the SELinux vulnerability when they
were given the opportunity to.  Now all RHEL boxes will get owned by
leeches.c :p

thanks to Dan Walsh for the great SELinux bypass even on "fixed" SELinux 
policies

and nice work Linus on trying to silently fix an 8 year old 
vulnerability, leaving vendors without patched kernels for their users.

  use ./wunderbar_emporium.sh for everything

don't have mplayer? watch an earlier version of the exploit at:
