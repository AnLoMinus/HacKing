searchsploit
------------

Searches local exploit-db sources. Note that multiple search terms get combined with "AND" in search.

.. code-block:: none

    $ searchsploit [search-terms]

If you have a service which a version number (e.g. Apache 2.3.2), always try multiple searches by removing the right-most version number each time, e.g. Apache 2.3, Apache 2, etc.
