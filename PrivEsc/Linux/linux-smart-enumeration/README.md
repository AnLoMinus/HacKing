First, a couple of useful oneliners ;)

`wget "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/raw/master/lse.sh" -O lse.sh;chmod 700 lse.sh`

`curl "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/raw/master/lse.sh" -Lo lse.sh;chmod 700 lse.sh`

Note that since version `2.10` you can *serve the script* to other hosts with the `-S` flag!

# linux-smart-enumeration
Linux enumeration tools for pentesting and CTFs

This project was inspired by https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum and uses
many of its tests.

Unlike LinEnum, `lse` tries to gradualy expose the information depending on its importance from a privesc point of view.

## What is it?

This shell script will show relevant information about the security of the local Linux system, helping to escalate privileges.

From version **2.0** it is *mostly* **POSIX** compliant and tested with `shellcheck` and `posh`.

It can also **monitor processes to discover recurrent program executions**. It monitors while it is executing all the other tests so you save some time. By default it monitors during 1 minute but you can choose the watch time with the `-p` parameter.

It has 3 levels of verbosity so you can control how much information you see.

In the default level you should see the highly important security flaws in the system. The level `1` (`./lse.sh -l1`) shows
interesting information that should help you to privesc. The level `2` (`./lse.sh -l2`) will just dump all the information it
gathers about the system.

By default it will ask you some questions: mainly the current user password (if you know it ;) so it can do some additional tests.

## How to use it?

The idea is to get the information gradually.

First you should execute it just like `./lse.sh`. If you see some green `yes!`, you probably have already some good stuff to work with.

If not, you should try the `level 1` verbosity with `./lse.sh -l1` and you will see some more information that can be interesting.

If that does not help, `level 2` will just dump everything you can gather about the service using `./lse.sh -l2`. In this case you might find useful to use `./lse.sh -l2 | less -r`.

You can also select what tests to execute by passing the `-s` parameter. With it you can select specific tests or sections to be executed. For example `./lse.sh -l2 -s usr010,net,pro` will execute the test `usr010` and all the tests in the sections `net` and `pro`. 


```
Use: ./lse.sh [options]

 OPTIONS
  -c           Disable color
  -i           Non interactive mode
  -h           This help
  -l LEVEL     Output verbosity level
                 0: Show highly important results. (default)
                 1: Show interesting results.
                 2: Show all gathered information.
  -s SELECTION Comma separated list of sections or tests to run. Available
               sections:
                 usr: User related tests.
                 sud: Sudo related tests.
                 fst: File system related tests.
                 sys: System related tests.
                 sec: Security measures related tests.
                 ret: Recurren tasks (cron, timers) related tests.
                 net: Network related tests.
                 srv: Services related tests.
                 pro: Processes related tests.
                 sof: Software related tests.
                 ctn: Container (docker, lxc) related tests.
               Specific tests can be used with their IDs (i.e.: usr020,sud)
  -e PATHS     Comma separated list of paths to exclude. This allows you
               to do faster scans at the cost of completeness
  -p SECONDS   Time that the process monitor will spend watching for
               processes. A value of 0 will disable any watch (default: 60)
  -S           Serve the lse.sh script in this host so it can be retrieved
               from a remote host.
```
## Is it pretty?
