# Steps to perform Penetration Testing

Step|Info
---|---
Planning | the planning process before the start of the pentest
Reconnaissance | The examiner collects information about the target system before the start of the pentest
Scanning | the Vulnerability Assessment process begins by applying the information obtained by Reconnaissance to start attacking the target system.
Gaining Access | Attempting to exploit the vulnerabilities found by applying the information obtained from Reconnaissance and Scanning
Maintaining Access | try to access deeper system
Covering tracks | this phase removes evidence of exploitation occurring, such as uploading backdoors, logs
Analysis | collects the collected information and identifies the cause for each detected vulnerability, and provides solutions to fix the detected vulnerabilities
Reporting | the process of reporting all vulnerabilities found:

# Types of Penetration Testing
We have five types of penetration testing −

Type|Info
---|---
Black Box | Here, the ethical hacker doesn’t have any information regarding the infrastructure or the network of the organization that he is trying to penetrate. In black-box penetration testing, the hacker tries to find the information by his own means.
Grey Box | It is a type of penetration testing where the ethical hacker has a partial knowledge of the infrastructure, like its domain name server.
White Box | In white-box penetration testing, the ethical hacker is provided with all the necessary information about the infrastructure and the network of the organization that he needs to penetrate.
External Penetration Testing | This type of penetration testing mainly focuses on network infrastructure or servers and their software operating under the infrastructure. In this case, the ethical hacker tries the attack using public networks through the Internet. The hacker attempts to hack the company infrastructure by attacking their webpages, webservers, public DNS servers, etc.
Internal Penetration Testing | In this type of penetration testing, the ethical hacker is inside the network of the company and conducts his tests from there.

Penetration testing can also cause problems such as system malfunctioning, system crashing, or data loss. Therefore, a company should take calculated risks before going ahead with penetration testing. The risk is calculated as follows and it is a management risk.

# Types of Hacking
We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here is a set of examples −

Type|Info
---|---
**Website Hacking** | Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces.
**Network Hacking** | Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.
**Email Hacking** | It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.
**Ethical Hacking** | Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.
**Password Hacking** | This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
**Computer Hacking** | This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system.
